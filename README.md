Bioinformatics Security Lab
This bioinformatics tool was developed as a testing ground to help me configure my home lab network and security operations center (SOC). I'm a fresh graduate from the University of Regina, where I earned a BSc in Biology (2020) and BSc in Computer Science (June 2025). I created this home lab to gain hands-on experience before applying for jobs in infosec and networking.
Project Overview
This MERN stack application serves dual purposes:
•	Functional bioinformatics tool for sequence analysis and genomic data processing
•	Vulnerable web application for penetration testing and security research in a controlled environment
Home Lab Architecture
Below is the layout of my hardware and their functions in my network:
Core Infrastructure:
•	Desktop - i9 CPU, GTX 1650 GPU, 16GB RAM, Windows 10 → SOC monitoring station
•	Asus TUF laptop - Windows 11, Kali Linux VM → Attack vector/penetration testing
•	Dell PowerEdge R220 - Linux Server 24.04.2 → Application server running MongoDB
•	Lenovo ThinkCenter - Linux Server → Jumpbox for secure access
Network Equipment:
•	TP-Link TL-SG108E → Managed switch for network segmentation
•	Asus RT-AX58U → Router with VPN capabilities
IoT Testing Environment:
•	CCTV cameras, tablets, and Arduino devices for IoT security research
Technology Stack
•	Frontend: React.js
•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
•	Database: MongoDB
•	Authentication: JWT
•	File Processing: Multer for bioinformatics file uploads
Learning Objectives
This project allows me to practice:
•	Full-stack web development
•	Network security and monitoring
•	Penetration testing methodologies
•	SOC operations and incident response
•	IoT device security assessment
